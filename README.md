## How it works

### The Backend

The back end is a .Net Core Web API
This requires - visual studio as it has not been containerized. 
Steps - Click the run button to complie and run the application. This will lead you to a Swagger UI with the endpoints.Which
        runs on[backend url](https://localhost:7723)

### The Frontend

The frontend is a Create-React-App Reactjs application 
This requires - Nodejs 
Steps         - npm install and npm start ( this will install node modules and run the application).
                runs on[frontend url](https://localhost:3000)

### Testing

Testing has not been implement on the application, Due to time constraits I avoided using TDD , However I did add the xUnit package on the backend and a solution which would have catered for the backend unit tests.

NB -Both frontend and backend need to run in parallel in order to fully function.
